blazetheme - an introduction to BlazeBlogger theme creation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document tries to provide a brief introduction on how to create new or
modify existing theme for your BlazeBlogger web presentation.

To make it as easy to alter as possible, BlazeBlogger theme consists of two
parts: the template file located in the C<.blaze/theme/> and corresponding
stylesheet in the C<.blaze/style/> directory. This way, you can easily
switch between different styles (e.g. bright and dark one) without even
touching the template file, which generally does not tend to vary much.

The theme file itself is just a bare HTML file (HTML 4.01 Strict is
recommended, although not required) with various placeholders to be
substituted by appropriate data. Each placeholder is an ordinary HTML
comment with a reserved string in it; note that while the case is not
significant, the fact that it has to be on a single line is.
