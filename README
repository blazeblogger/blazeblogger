1. OVERVIEW

BlazeBlogger is a simple to use but capable CMS for the command line. Being
written in  Perl as a cross-platform application  and  producing the static
content without  the need of database servers  or server-side scripting, it
is  literally a CMS without  boundaries  suitable for a wide variety of web
presentations, from  personal  weblog to a project page  or even a  company
presentation.

Using BlazeBlogger is really easy.  Strongly inspired  by Git in its design
and  in the best spirit  of Unix philosophy, it comes as a set  of  smaller
utilities that  do one thing and do it well rather than the monolithic pro-
gram for everything. Keeping the default configuration, you can have a full
featured blog with the first post in only three steps!

1.1 MAIN FEATURES

  * Generates valid HTML 4.01 Strict pages and RSS 2.0.
  * Generates completely browsable yearly and monthly archive and tags.

  * Comes with tools for easy management of your blog.

1.2 EXAMPLE USAGE

  $ blaze-add   # Write new post in your favourite editor.
  $ blaze-make  # Generate the static content of your blog.

For a brief introduction to BlazeBlogger usage, read blazeintro(1) man page
or its online version at <http://blaze.blackened.cz/tutorial/>.


2. CUSTOMIZATION

2.1 CHANGING THE BLOG THEME

Changing the theme of your blog is rather straightforward. First, visit the
<http://blaze.blackened.cz/themes/> and pick one that suits you best.  Then
extract the content of the theme package  to the directory where the static
content is being generated;  for example, to install the theme called  Vec-
torLover:

  $ tar xfz vectorlover-1.0.1.tar.gz

Now  open the template file, in this case vectorlover.html, in your  favou-
rite text editor and replace the sidebar sections like `About'  or  `Links'
with appropriate information. Then place the template file  and the corres-
ponding  stylesheet to the .blaze/theme/ and .blaze/style/ directories res-
pectively:

  $ mv vectorlover.html .blaze/theme/
  $ mv vectorlover.css .blaze/style/

Finally, change the configuration to use this theme:

  $ blaze-config blog.theme vectorlover.html
  $ blaze-config blog.style vectorlover.css

Run `blaze-make' to re-create  the static content  with the new  outfit and
you are done!

For more information on how to create your own theme, see blazetheme(1) man
page, or read its HTML version online at  <http://blaze.blackened.cz/files/
man/en/blazetheme.html>.

2.2 CHANGING THE LOCALIZATION

There are several translations  of  BlazeBlogger ready to be used instantly
in your blog that you can either copy from the  lang/ directory of the Bla-
zeBlogger source package, or download it from the  appropriate  section  of
the project homepage.  To change the blog language,  first place the proper
language file to the .blaze/lang/ directory:

  $ cp eu_ES .blaze/lang/

Then change the configuration to use this translation:

  $ blaze-config blog.lang eu_ES

Finally, run `blaze-make' to re-create the static content.

If the translation  you are looking for  is not available,  do not despair:
the language  file  is quite straightforward  and translating it should not
take you much time. If you do  so,  please,  consider sending it to the up-
stream, so that it can be made public.


3. DEVELOPMENT

As a version control system for its source code, BlazeBlogger uses Git with
a public repository  located on Gitorious.  To get  the latest  development
version, you can either use the following command:

  git clone git://gitorious.org/blazeblogger/mainline.git blazeblogger

or, if you are behind a restrictive firewall:

  git clone http://git.gitorious.org/blazeblogger/mainline.git blazeblogger

If you are planning to make some interesting changes, please, consider clo-
ning the project on Gitorious, so that I can follow you and eventually pull
your work to the upstream.


4. BUGS

To report bug or even send patch,  either add new issue to the project bug-
tracker at <http://code.google.com/p/blazeblogger/issues/>,  or  visit  the
discussion group at <http://groups.google.com/group/blazeblogger/>. You can
also contact the author directly via e-mail.
