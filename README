1. OVERVIEW

BlazeBlogger is a simple to use but capable CMS for the command line. Being
written in Perl as  a cross-platform application  and producing static con-
tent without the need of database  servers or server-side scripting,  it is
literally a CMS without  boundaries suitable for a wide variety of web pre-
sentations, from  a personal weblog  to a  project page  or  even a company
website.

1.1 Notable Features

  * Generates valid HTML 4.01 Strict or XHTML 1.1 pages,  and RSS 2.0 feed.
  * Generates yearly and monthly archives, and supports tags.
  * Allows you to create both blog posts and pages.
  * Enables a quick change of theme, style sheet, or localization.
  * Comes with tools for easy management of your blog.

1.2 Example Usage

  ~]$ blaze-init   # Creates a new repository in .blaze
  ~]$ blaze-add    # Allows you to write a new post in your favorite editor

2. DEVELOPMENT

As a revision control system  for its  source code,  BlazeBlogger  uses Git
with a public repository  located on GitHub.  To get the latest development
version of BlazeBlogger, type the following command at a shell prompt:

  git clone https://github.com/blazeblogger/blazeblogger.git

If you are planning to make some interesting changes, please, consider for-
king the project on GitHub  so that I can follow you  and eventually  merge
your code with the upstream version.
