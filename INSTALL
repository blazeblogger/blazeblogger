2.1. Installing on Debian

BlazeBlogger is currently available in  both testing (Squeeze) and unstable
(Sid) version of Debian. To install it, open a terminal, and run the follo-
wing command:

  ~]# apt-get install blazeblogger

2.2. Installing on Fedora

BlazeBlogger is currently available in both Fedora 12 (Constantine)  and 13
(Goddard).  To install it,  open a terminal, and run the following command:

  ~]# yum install blazeblogger

2.3. Installing on Ubuntu

BlazeBlogger  is currently available in  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS  (Lucid Lynx). To
install it, open a terminal, and run the following command:

  ~]# sudo apt-get install blazeblogger


3. INSTALLING ON WINDOWS

Currently, there is no installer for Microsoft Windows. To use BlazeBlogger
there,  download the latest version from the official homepage,  unpack it,
and use the batch  files that are  located in  blazeblogger-1.1.0/windows/.
For example:

  C:\blazeblogger-1.1.0\windows> blaze init

Alternatively, you can use BlazeBlogger with Cygwin. In that case, see Sec-
tion 4, "Installing from the Source Code" for detailed installation instru-
ctions.


4. INSTALLING FROM THE SOURCE CODE

To install  BlazeBlogger  from the source code,  download the latest source
package from the official homepage, and unpack it:

  ~]# tar xfz blazeblogger-1.1.0.tar.gz

A directory called  blazeblogger-1.1.0 will  appear  in the current working
directory. Get into it, and type "make install" at a shell prompt:

  ~]# cd blazeblogger-1.1.0
  blazeblogger-1.1.0]# make install

This will install runnable scripts and their corresponding  manual pages to
the predefined /usr/local/bin/ and /usr/local/share/man/ directories respe-
ctively. Note that you can change the destination directory by changing the
value of "prefix". For example, to install scripts to ~/local/bin/, and ma-
nual pages to ~/local/share/man/, type the following command:

  blazeblogger-1.1.0]# make prefix=$HOME/local install

Additionally, on UNIX operating systems, you can also install the Bash com-
pletion support. To do so,  get into the  unix/bash_completion/  directory,
and run "make install".

  blazeblogger-1.1.0]# cd unix/bash_completion
  bash_completion]# make install
