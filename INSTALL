1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

A working installation of Perl is required, version 5.8.8 or higher.

Note that with the exception of Ubuntu,  you have to be logged in as super-
user in order to run commands described in this section. To do so, type the
following at a shell prompt:

  ~]$ su -

2.1. Installing on Debian

BlazeBlogger is currently available in  both testing (Squeeze) and unstable
(Sid) version of Debian. To install it, open a terminal, and run the follo-
wing command:

  ~]# apt-get install blazeblogger

2.2. Installing on Ubuntu

BlazeBlogger  is currently available in  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS  (Lucid Lynx). To
install it, open a terminal, and run the following command:

  ~]# sudo apt-get install blazeblogger


3. INSTALLING ON WINDOWS

Currently, there is no installer for Microsoft Windows. To use BlazeBlogger
there,  download the latest version from the official homepage,  unpack it,
and use the batch  files that are  located in  blazeblogger-1.2.0/windows/.
For example:

  C:\blazeblogger-1.2.0\windows> blaze init

Alternatively, you can use BlazeBlogger with Cygwin. In that case, see Sec-
tion 4, "Installing from the Source Code" for detailed installation instru-
ctions.


4. INSTALLING FROM THE SOURCE CODE

To install  BlazeBlogger  from the source code,  download the latest source
package from the official homepage, and unpack it:

  ~]$ tar xfz blazeblogger-1.2.0.tar.gz

A directory called  blazeblogger-1.2.0 will  appear  in the current working
directory.  Switch to superuser, get into the newly created directory,  and
type "make install" at a shell prompt:

  blazeblogger-1.2.0]# make install

This will install executables, manual pages, documentation, and application
data to the /usr/local/ directory,  and place  the Bash completion  file to
/etc/bash_completion.d/. To use a different installation directory,  change
the value of "prefix" on the command line. For example, if you want to ins-
tall BlazeBlogger to /usr/,  type the following command:

  blazeblogger-1.2.0]# make prefix=/usr install

Alternatively, you can choose to install executables only. For instance, to
install BlazeBlogger into your home directory, type:

  blazeblogger-1.2.0]$ make prefix=$HOME install_bin

Finally,  if you prefer to install all available files, but you do not have
superuser privileges, change the value of "compdir" to a directory you have
access to. For example:

  blazeblogger-1.2.0]$ make prefix=$HOME compdir='$(prefix)/etc' install
