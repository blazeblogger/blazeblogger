   directory of the BlazeBlogger source package.


1. GENERAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

All parts of BlazeBlogger package are standalone scripts  written  in  Perl
and as such, it should be runnable on almost any operating system, provided
that following dependencies are met:

  * Working installation of Perl (tested on version 5.10.1, but 5.8.8 ought
    to work perfectly).


2. INSTALLING ON UNIX SYSTEMS

The easiest way to install BlazeBlogger on Unix operating systems,  such as
Linux or various *BSDs,  is to use the existing Makefile. As a root, simply
get into the main directory of the BlazeBlogger source package and type:

  make install

This will install the runnable scripts and their corresponding man pages to
the predefined /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share/man respectively. Never-
theless,  if these locations do not satisfy your needs, you can either edit
the relevant part of the Makefile, or you can change the prefix directly on
the command line like this:

  make prefix=/some/location install

Similarly, typing

  make uninstall

or, if you have previously changed the destination directory,

  make prefix=/some/location uninstall

will completely remove all installed files.

On the other hand, you can also run the scripts directly from their present
location or copy the content of src/ (and unix/ in  case you  intend to use
the command wrapper) directory somewhere in the $PATH yourself.


3. INSTALLING ON WINDOWS

Currently, there is no  installer for Microsoft Windows  and the  preferred
way to use BlazeBlogger is to run the batch files  from their present loca-
tion. To do so, run your favourite command line interpreter (e.g. cmd.exe),
get into the  windows/  directory of the BlazeBlogger  source  package  and
type commands in the following form:

  blaze.bat init [options]

or:

  blaze-init.bat [options]

Alternatively,  you can run the Perl scripts directly  from the src/ direc-
tory like this:

  perl blaze-init.pl [options]

Note that you might want to change the default editor first:

  blaze.bat config core.editor C:\Location\Of\Your\editor.exe

You can also run BlazeBlogger in Cygwin.
