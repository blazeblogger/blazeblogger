1. GENERAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

You have  to have the  bash completion enabled,  either in /etc/bashrc,  or
~/.bashrc. To do so, place the following code to any of the above files:

  if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
  fi


2. INSTALLING ON UNIX SYSTEMS

The easiest way  to install the bash completion  for BlazeBlogger  on  Unix
operating systems is to use the existing Makefile. As superuser, simply get
into the directory with this instructions and type:

  make install

This will install the relevant file to the /etc/bash_completion.d/ directo-
ry; however, if this location do not satisfy your needs, you can change the
target directory directly on the command line like this:

  make prefix=/some/location install


2. UNINSTALLING ON UNIX SYSTEMS

Similarly to the installation, typing

  make uninstall

or, if you have previously changed the destination directory,

  make prefix=/some/location uninstall

will completely remove all installed files from the system.
